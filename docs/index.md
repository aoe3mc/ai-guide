# Welcome to the AOE3 AI Scripting Guide!

This guide extends the [AOE3 Mods
Guide](https://support.ageofempires.com/hc/en-us/articles/8475640158228-Mods-Guide-Introduction)
by elaborating on AI scripting, which the Mods Guide does not cover.

This guide tries to be beginner-friendly, but it expects readers to have at
least a basic computer knowledge like navigating to any folder and performing
most common file operations: create, open, edit, save, copy, cut, paste, etc.
