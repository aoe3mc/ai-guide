## What is this guide about?

This guide extends the [AOE3 Mods

by elaborating on AI scripting, which the Mods Guide does not cover.

## Who is this guide for?

This guide tries to be beginner-friendly, but it expects readers to have at
least a basic computer knowledge like navigating to any folder and performing
most common file operations: create, open, edit, save, copy, cut, paste, etc.

does not cover every aspect of AI scripting, but it tries to cover the most
important ones. If you have any suggestions or wish to contribute, please
