# Gatherer Limit Constants

!!! note "These constants are probably hardcoded"

    It is possible to change the gatherer limit in the techtree, and these
    constants might not reflect that. Some mods may as well make custom
    mines and farms that have a different base limit.

```cpp title="Gatherer Limit Constants"
extern const int cMaxSettlersPerMine = 20;
extern const int cMaxSettlersPerMill = 10;
```
