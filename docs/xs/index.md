# The XS Language

!!! note "Already familiar with XS?"

    If you are already familiar with XS or a language similar to C/C++, you may
    want to jump directly to the [AI Scripting](../ai/index.md) part.

XS is the language used in AOE3 to control the AI, to create custom maps and to
create custom triggers. Using the XS language, AOE3 modders can write code in a
text file called a script (AI script, RM script, TR script), which the game can
load, read and execute. The process of writing a script is called scripting.

This guide focuses primarily on AI scripting, but the knowledge acquired
through this part of the guide is applicable to RM and TR scripting as well.
