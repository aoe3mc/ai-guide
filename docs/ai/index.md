# AI Scripting

!!! note "Note for rookies"

    If you are unfamiliar with XS, especially if you have never programmed
    before, you should start from [The XS Language](../xs/index.md) section
    first.

Age of Empires III contains an internal AI that we can consider as a player.
Just like a player, the internal AI is able to select units, move them, make
them chop trees, etc. In short, it can do everything a player can do.

However, the internal AI cannot play the game on its own. In order for it to
do anything, it needs to be given orders. These orders are written in an AI
script.

This section of the guide elaborates on the features available for use in an AI
script.
